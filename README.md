## Get started
Learn how to include CERMJS in your project

#### Installation
The best way to consume CERMJS is via the npm package which you can install with npm.
> npm install cermjs

#### Design pattern
CERM is a module based on a design pattern: the singleton. The objective is to restrict the instance of its class to a single call. In this way, no matter where you call it from, it will always be the same instance.


#### Start 
To call this module, nothing could be easier. Simply import the module as soon as you need it like this: 
```js
import cerm from "cermjs";
```
